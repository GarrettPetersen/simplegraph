# simplegraph

This is a simple little graphing package for making graphs and exporting them as
base64-encoded SVGs.

## Categorical Graph

The categorical graph is for data that comes in distinct categories. It can
generate a bar chart, a stacked bar chart, dots, or lines.

## Ribbon Graph

The ribbon graph is for comparing two numbers on the same scale and a third
number on a different scale (represented through color).
